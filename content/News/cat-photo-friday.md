# Cat Photo Friday is Here! 🐱

It's the most wonderful day of the week – **Cat Photo Friday!**

Every Friday, our Discord transforms into the internet's cutest corner as guild members share photos of their feline overlords. Here are this week's highlights:

## Featured Floofs

### Mittens (by Elyndra)
This absolute unit of a tabby cat has been featured 12 weeks in a row. He supervises all raid nights from his designated chair.

### Sir Fluffington (by Tankzilla)
Don't let the name fool you – Sir Fluffington is a 2-pound kitten with the attitude of a mythic raider.

### Whiskers & Beans (by Healzplz)
These brother-sister duo are inseparable and have been known to interrupt streams with surprise keyboard walks.

## Join the Tradition!

Got a cat? Share them in #cat-photos every Friday. No cat? Dog photos are accepted on alternate weeks. 🐕
