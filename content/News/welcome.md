# Welcome to Our Cozy Guild!

Hey there, friend! 👋

Welcome to the coziest corner of US-Illidan! We're a guild that believes raiding should come with good vibes, friendly banter, and the occasional cat photo spam in Discord.

## What We're All About

- **AOTC Raiding** – We clear Heroic every tier on a relaxed 2-night schedule
- **M+ Madness** – Keys running all day, every day
- **Fun Events** – Transmog competitions, achievement hunting, and more
- **Cat Photos** – Yes, this is a requirement

We can't wait to have you join our adventures. Hop in Discord and say hi – the kettle's always on! ☕
