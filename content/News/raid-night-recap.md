# Raid Night Recap - Queen Ansurek Down!

**WE DID IT, FRIENDS!** 🎉

After what felt like a million pulls (okay, it was 47), our beloved band of misfits finally brought down Queen Ansurek on Heroic!

## The Final Pull

It was 10:45 PM. Half the raid was running on coffee and vibes. Our main tank was making questionable life choices with their cooldowns. But somehow, some way, everything clicked.

When she dropped, Discord exploded:
- **3 people cried** (happy tears!)
- **12 people screamed** 
- **1 cat was startled** (sorry, Mittens 🐱)

## MVPs of the Night

Shoutout to our healers who kept us alive through our collective braincell shortage, and our DPS who finally stopped standing in the bad stuff.

**AOTC secured! Now let's do it again next tier.** 💪
