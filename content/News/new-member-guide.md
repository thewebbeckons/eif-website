# New Member Guide

**Welcome to the family!** 🎊

So you've decided to join the friendliest guild on Illidan? Excellent choice! Here's everything you need to know to settle in.

## Step 1: Say Hi!

Pop into our Discord and introduce yourself in #introductions. Tell us:
- Your main character & spec
- How you found us
- Most importantly: **do you have pets?** (photos encouraged)

## Step 2: Get Set Up

- Grab your roles in #role-select
- Check out #raid-schedule if you want to join raids
- Browse #lfg for M+ groups

## Step 3: The Unwritten Rules

1. **Be kind** – We're all here to have fun
2. **Nobody's perfect** – Wipes happen, we laugh and pull again  
3. **Cat photos > loot drama** – Priorities, people!
4. **Ask questions** – No such thing as a silly one

## Need Help?

Tag any officer in Discord – we're always happy to help! Usually distracted by cat photos, but we'll get back to you.

**Welcome home, friend! 🏠**
